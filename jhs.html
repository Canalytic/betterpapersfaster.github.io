                        <p class="text-white font-weight-bold">I started undergrad as a literature student, but followed my deep interest in science and eventually got a PhD in biochemistry. During my post-doc at a CAS lab in Beijing (P450 enzymology), I realized that I could contribute much more to science as a rhetorician and scientific editor than I could as a researcher at the bench.  After consulting with about 300 life scientists from 6 countries,  I was thrilled when I was recruited as the Director of Scientific Literature at NIBS. It was highly validating for my work that the #1 ranking bioscience research institute in China wanted to have me in-house; at NIBS I help their world-leading scientists prepare their manuscripts and train their students and staff about the paper writing process.</p>
                        <p class="text-white font-weight-bold">After working on around 800 manuscripts, I had a breakthrough idea to dramatically simplify manuscript writing. An idea about how to include and prioritize the essential bits, while cutting out the useless aspects that trip up most scientific writers. Since then, I've engineered my big idea into an 8-gate process, and I founded Better Papers Faster™ to bring my process to world.</p>
                        <p class="text-white font-weight-bold">To date, I’ve worked on more than 1,700 life science manuscripts, and I have given writing presentations to audiences of more than 400 people at many institutes and universities. With my help, biology and medical researchers are completing their papers from start to finish in less than one week, and their drafts are far superior to what they would have cooked up on their own without the process. I can help you to finish your manuscript with confidence, knowing that your research will have its greatest chance of acceptance for publication.</p>
