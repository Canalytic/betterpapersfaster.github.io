        <p2 class="text-dark-50 mb-4">I'm going to give you a set of easy to complete assignments that prepare you for a one-on-one meeting with me. In the one-on-one meeting we're going to talk about 1) your target journal, 2)  your reviewers, and 3) we're going to pick the best suited language and structure to make your research clear, attractive, and easy to accept. After that meeting, you're going to use the tools and training I provide to quickly write up each of the relevant sections of your manuscript. If you get stuck at some spot, I'm here to help out. You'll be learning extremely efficient ways to get your message down clearly in a way that reviewers will respect and appreciate. You'll avoid things that annoy reviewers, make them upset, or might make them immediately reject your paper. Then we finish using a series of forms to make sure you have everything you need for the discussion and the introduction and that you're not wasting your reviewers’ time. It’s basic and proceeds step-by-step: Watch a video, do the assignment, check in. Watch the next video, do the assignment, etc.
